			Contents are surrounded by opening and closing tags which can be a source of errors

			when an opening tag is created to prevent this.

				I was a little unsure about the DOM from the class information, but found a good explanation here: 
				<a href="https://css-tricks.com/dom/">Good references at the bottom of this page.</a>
				The biggest take away from all of it, is no matter what platform you are using, the structure of tree allows
				you to gather, and therefore manipulate information. I work in clinical informatics, where structured data is useful and relavant,
				and free text does nobody any good except the person reading it. We say that because "structured data" is reportable/queryable.
				The structure in EHRs is very different between EHRs, some even use hierarchical databases rather than relational. 
				The DOM of html documents seems to allow for a consistency of form, making APIs a lot more common than EHRs that can talk.

			Each tag can be empty, contain text or another tag.
    		<br>
			Tags can include attributes and the values of those attributes:

			EXAMPLE &#60;h1 class="article"> where article is the value of the class attribute. </div>

				One option is to define elements in the style sheet: 
				<pre>
p {
define paragraph style elements here

			<h2>Box Sizing and Positioning</h2>

			box-sizing: border-box;

				alternatively, set sizes in terms of percentages instead of pixels.
			<br>
				display: flex; allows divs to appear next to each other.
